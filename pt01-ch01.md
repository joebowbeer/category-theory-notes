# [Category: The Essence of Composition](http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/11/04/category-the-essence-of-composition/)


## Rules of category

 1. There is _objects_ and _arrows_ (morphisms)
 2. Composition: if there is a morphism `f` from `A` to `B`, and there is a morphism `g` from `B` to `C`, there is must be a morphism from `A` to `C` (composition of `f` and `g` â€” `g . f`)
 3. Associativity: `(h . g) . f == h . (g . f)`
 4. Identity: for each object `A` there is must be an morphism <code>id<sub>A</sub></code> from `A` to `A`, such that <code>id<sub>A</sub> . f == f</code> and <code>f . id<sub>B</sub> == f</code>


## Challenges

> 1. Implement, as best as you can, the identity function in your favorite language (or the second favorite, if your favorite language happens to be Haskell).

```js
function id(a) {
  return a
}
```

> 2. Implement the composition function in your favorite language. It takes two functions as arguments and returns a function that is their composition.

```js
function compose(f, g) {
  return (x) => f(g(x));
}
```


> 3. Write a program that tries to test that your composition function respects identity.

```js
function inc(x) {
  return x + 1
}

console.log(inc(1) === compose(id, inc)(1)) // => true
console.log(inc(1) === compose(inc, id)(1)) // => true
```

> 4. Is the world-wide web a category in any sense? Are links morphisms?

At a certain degree, if there is a link on page `A` to page `B`, and a link on page `B` to page `C`, there not necessarily a link on page `A` to page `C`. Also there is no _identety_ link on every page.

> 5. Is Facebook a category, with people as objects and friendships as morphisms?

Again if `A` and `B` are friends, and `B` and `C` are, `A` and `C` may not know each other. Also on Facebook one can't technically be a friend to herself.

> 6. When is a directed graph a category?

When there is an _identity_ edge for each node. And, if there is an edge from `A` to `B`, and from `B` to `C`, there is also one from `A` to `C`.
