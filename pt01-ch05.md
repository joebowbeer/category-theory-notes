# [Products and Coproducts](http://bartoszmilewski.com/2015/01/07/products-and-coproducts/)


## Follow the Arrows

_Universal construction_ — a common construction in category theory for defining objects in terms of their relationships. We pick a pattern (a particular shape constructed from objects and morphisms) and look for all its occurrences in the category. We also establish some ranking among those hits, and pick what could be considered the best fit.

Examples: Initial/terminal object, product/coproduct.


## Initial Object

_The initial object_ is the object that has one and only one morphism going to any object in the category.

 - Unique up to isomorphism
 - In _Set_ (cat. of types and functions) the _initial Object_ is _empty set_: `absurd: Void -> a`
 - In _poset_ (Partial order) the _initial Object_ is _the least_ object (if exists)


## Terminal Object

_The terminal object_ is the object with one and only one morphism coming to it from any object in the category.

 - Unique up to isomorphism
 - In _Set_ the _terminal object_ is _a singleton_: `unit :: a -> ()`
 - In _poset_ the _terminal object_ is _the biggest_ object (if exists)


## Duality

For any `C` we can define <code>C<sup>op</sup></code> by __reversing all arrows__ and __redefine composition__.

> For every construction you come up with, there is its opposite; and for every theorem you prove, you get one for free. The constructions in the opposite category are often prefixed with “co”, so you have products and coproducts, monads and comonads, cones and cocones, limits and colimits, and so on.


## Isomorphisms

_Isomorphism_ — inversable morphism, or a pair of morphism `g` and `f` that so:

```
f . g = id
g . f = id
```

Prove for _uniqueness up to isomorphism_ of any 2 initial objects:

All arrow in the diagram are __unique__ (from defenition of initial object), so `f . g` have to be `id` and vice versa.


## Products

Pattern: an object `c` with two morphisms (projections) `p` and `q` to objects `a` and `b` respectively.

Ranking: For 2 candidates `c` is _better_ than `c'` if there is a morphism `m` from `c'` to `c` that so:

```
p' = p . m
q' = q . m
```

And _better_ if `m` is unique.

> A _product_ of two objects `a` and `b` is the object `c` equipped with two _projections_ such that for any other object `c’` equipped with two _projections_ there is a unique morphism `m` from `c’` to `c` that factorizes those projections.

A function `p' -> q' -> m` is called _factorizer_.

Example: in __Set__, for `a` being `Int` and `b` being `Bool`, the best fit is `Pair<Int, Bool>` with `fst` and `snd` as _projections_ — _cartesian product_ of sets Int and Bool.


## Coproduct

Similar to _product_ but with arrows reversed. The morphisms are called _injections_. And in ranking `m` is also reversed.

> A _coproduct_ of two objects `a` and `b` is the object `c` equipped with two _injections_ such that for any other object `c’` equipped with two _injections_ there is a unique morphism `m` from `c` to `c’` that factorizes those injections.

Example: in __Set__, for `a` being `Int` and `b` being `Bool`, the best fit is `Either<Int, Bool>` with `left` and `right` as _injections_ — _disjoint union_ of sets Int and Bool.


## Challenges

> Show that the terminal object is unique up to unique isomorphism.

Exact the same as for _Initial Object_ above, even the image is same.

> What is a product of two objects in a poset? Hint: Use the universal construction.

The _biggest_ object _less_ than `a` and `b` (if exists).

> What is a coproduct of two objects in a poset?

Similar to above — the _lesser_ object that _bigger_ that `a` and `b` (if exists).

> Implement the equivalent of Haskell `Either` as a generic type in your favorite language (other than Haskell).

```js
function left(x) {
  return {type: 'left', value: x}
}

function right(x) {
  return {type: 'right', value: x}
}
```

> Show that `Either` is a “better” coproduct than `int` equipped with two injections:
```cpp
int i(int n) { return n; }
int j(bool b) { return b? 0: 1; }
```
Hint: Define a function `int m(Either const & e)` that factorizes `i` and `j`.

```js
function m(e) {
  if (e.type === 'left') {
    return e.value
  } else {
    return e.value ? 0 : 1
  }
}
```

> Continuing the previous problem: How would you argue that `int` with the two injections `i` and `j` cannot be “better” than Either?

`true` and `0` when _injected_ to int is indistinguishable (same for `false` and `1`).

> Still continuing: What about these injections?
```cpp
int i(int n) {
    if (n < 0) return n;
    return n + 2;
}
int j(bool b) { return b? 0: 1; }
```

hmm...

> Come up with an inferior candidate for a coproduct of `int` and `bool` that cannot be better than `Either` because it allows multiple acceptable morphisms to `Either`.

The above first version of `int` coproduct:

```js
function m1(x) {
  if (x === 0) {
    return right(true)
  } else if (x === 1) {
    return right(false)
  } else {
    return left(x)
  }
}

function m2(x) {
  return left(x)
}
```
