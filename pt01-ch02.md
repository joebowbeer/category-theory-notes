# [Types and Functions](http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/11/24/types-and-functions/)


## What Are Types?

Types — sets of values. Sets can be finite or infinite.

There is a category of sets, which is called __Set__. In __Set__, objects are sets and morphisms are functions.

In __Set__ an identity function maps each element of a set to itself.

Every type has one special value — the _bottom_, denoted by `⊥`. This “value” corresponds to a non-terminating computation, or a runtime error. So a function `f :: Bool -> Bool`, for instnce, can return `True`, `False`, or `⊥`. Functions that may return bottom are called _partial_, as opposed to _total_ functions. Strictly speaking, category of types with _bottom_ called __Hask__ rather than __Set__.


## Why Do We Need a Mathematical Model?

There is two ways to reason about programs — _operational semantics_ and _denotational semantics_. With former to make sure a proggram is correct we run it through interpreter in our heads. With the latter to prove that a programm is correct we prove a mathematical theorem.

Not every program can be expressed using _denotational semantics_, take reading a character from the keyboard or sending a packet across the network as examples. Monads can help with it.

Only with _denotational semantics_ we can perform formal proofs of correctness of software.


## Examples of Types

The type corresponding to an empty set is called `Void` in Haskell. It’s a type that’s not inhabited by any values. You can define function that takes value of `Void`, but you can't call it (because can't create an instance of `Void` to pass to it):

```haskell
absurd :: Void -> a
absurd _ = 1
```

Note that we can also define `id` for `Void` (it's the only funcion we can define that returns `Void`):

```haskell
idVoid :: Void -> Void
idVoid x = x
```

The type corresponds to a singleton set is called "unit", it has only one value (that is also called "unit"?). In C++ this type is called `void`, and in Haskell both the type and only inhabitant of it denoted as `()`. One can define, implement, and call function from _unit_ to `a`:

```haskell
f44 :: () -> Integer
f44 () = 44
```

One can define, implement, and call function that return _unit_:

```haskell
fInt :: Integer -> ()
fInt _ = ()
```

If it's a pure function it simply discards the argument, in laguages like C++ functions with this type usually used for side effects.


## Challenges

> Define a higher-order function (or a function object) memoize in your favorite language. This function takes a pure function f as an argument and returns a function that behaves almost exactly like f, except that it only calls the original function once for every argument, stores the result internally, and subsequently returns this stored result every time it’s called with the same argument. You can tell the memoized function from the original by watching its performance. For instance, try to memoize a function that takes a long time to evaluate. You’ll have to wait for the result the first time you call it, but on subsequent calls, with the same argument, you should get the result immediately.

```js
function memoize(f) {
  const cache = new Map()
  return (x) => {
    if (cache.has(x)) {
      return cache.get(x)
    } else {
      let result = f(x)
      cache.set(x, result)
      return result
    }
  }
}
```

> Try to memoize a function from your standard library that you normally use to produce random numbers. Does it work?

```js
const rand = memoize(Math.random)
rand() // => 0.3242777899240006
rand() // => 0.3242777899240006
```

Define "work" :)

> Most random number generators can be initialized with a seed. Implement a function that takes a seed, calls the random number generator with that seed, and returns the result. Memoize that function. Does it work?

```js

// http://stackoverflow.com/a/19303725/478603
// Avoid zero or any multiple of Math.PI as a seed.
function createGenerator(seed) {
  return () => {
    const x = Math.sin(seed++) * 10000
    return x - Math.floor(x)
  }
}

function rand(seed) {
  return createGenerator(seed)()
}

const randM = memoize(rand)

randM(1) // => 0.7098480789645691
randM(2) // => 0.9742682568175951
```

> How many different functions are there from Bool to Bool? Can you implement them all?

Two: `id = (x) => x` and `not = (x) => !x`.

> Draw a picture of a category whose only objects are the types Void, () (unit), and Bool; with arrows corresponding to all possible functions between these types. Label the arrows with the names of the functions.
