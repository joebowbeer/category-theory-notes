# [Categories Great and Small](http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/12/05/categories-great-and-small/)

## Simple Graphs

When you add missing morphisms (_composition_ ans _identity_) to a directed graph, you create a so called _free category_ from a given graph.


## Orders

_Preorder_ — is a category where morphisms are relations of being less than or equal.

_Partial order_ — is an _preorder_ where for all `a <= b` and `b <= a`, `a` is `b`. There can be cycles in _preorder_ but not in _partial order_. You can create a _partial order_ from any directed acyclic graph by completing it up to a _free category_.

_Linear order_ or _total order_ — is a _partial order_ where any two objects are in a relation with each other, one way or another.

_Hom-set_ — is set of all morphisms from `a` to `b` in category `C` (written as `C(a, b)` or <code>Hom<sub>C</sub>(a, b)<code>). In any _preorder_ for any `a` and `b`, `C(a, b)` is either empty set or singleton, and `C(a, a)` is a singleton.

Sorting algorithms, such as quicksort, bubble sort, merge sort, etc., can only work correctly on total orders. Partial orders can be sorted using topological sort.


## Monoid as Set

_Monoid_ is a set with a binary operation. The operation must be associative, and there must be an _unit_ element it the set:

```
(a <op> b) <op> c = a <op> (b <op> c)
unit <op> a = a
a <op> unit = a
```

In Haskell _Monoid_ type class defined as:

```haskell
class Monoid m where
    mempty  :: m
    mappend :: m -> m -> m
```

## Monoid as Category

In Haskell `mappend` defined as `m->(m->m)` so it maps an _element_ of a _monoid set_ to a function acting on that set.
If `mappend` applied to the _unit_, the result function will be _id_. When we compose those fucntions it's similar as when we apply the _operation_ to elements (e.g. `add5 . add7 = add12` and `5 + 7 = 12`).

In category of types and function monoid looks like this: ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/825702/7919964/57d9a522-08a4-11e5-8af7-9f60a6ebab23.png)

We can always recover a set monoid from a category monoid (see img), the elements will be `M(a, a)` (all morphisms), the _operation_ will be `.`, and _unit_ is the _id_ morphism.

## Challenges

> Generate a free category from: A graph with one node and no edges

Just add _id_.

> Generate a free category from: A graph with one node and one (directed) edge (hint: this edge can be composed with itself)

Add _id_, and infinite number of: `a . a`, `a . a . a`, `a . a . a . a`, etc.

> Generate a free category from: A graph with two nodes and a single arrow between them

Add _id_ to each node.

> Generate a free category from: A graph with a single node and 26 arrows marked with the letters of the alphabet: a, b, c … z.

Similar to #2 case.

> What kind of order is this: A set of sets with the inclusion relation: A is included in B if every element of A is also an element of B.

Partial order.

> What kind of order is this: C++ types with the following subtyping relation: T1 is a subtype of T2 if a pointer to T1 can be passed to a function that expects a pointer to T2 without triggering a compilation error.

Not familiar with C++, _partial order_ I guess, but maybe a _preorder_.

> Considering that Bool is a set of two values True and False, show that it forms two (set-theoretical) monoids with respect to, respectively, operator && (AND) and || (OR).

For `&&` the unit will be `True`, and for `||` the unit is `False`, and composition obviously works in both cases.

> Represent the Bool monoid with the AND operator as a category: List the morphisms and their rules of composition.

Morphisms: `not` and `id`. Compositions: `not . id = not`, `id . not = not`.

> Represent addition modulo 3 as a monoid category.

Single object with morphisms `add0`, `add1`, and `add2`.
